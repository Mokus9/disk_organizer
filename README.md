Modeling and Printing an Organizer for Grinding Discs

1. Modeling Process

1. Design Creation:
   - I started by designing a detailed model of the organizer in a CAD program Rhino 7.
   - I ensured that the design was optimized for strength and stability.

2. Modeling Details:
   - I used fillets and chamfers to improve the aesthetics and reduce stress points.

2. Preparing for Printing

1. Slicing the Model:
   - I sliced the model into layers using a slicing software PrushaSlicer.
   - I adjusted the layer height and infill density to achieve the desired strength.

2. Printing Settings:
   - I selected the appropriate printing material, such as PLA.
   - I set the print temperature and speed to optimize the print quality.

3. Printing Process

1. Printing on the 3D Printer:
   - I loaded the sliced model onto the 3D printer.
   - The printer extruded plastic filament, layer by layer, to create the physical organizer.

2. Post-Printing Cleanup:
   - After the print was complete, I removed any support material.
   - I sanded the surface to achieve a smooth finish.

4. Conclusion

The process of modeling, printing, and finishing an organizer for grinding discs was a rewarding and educational experience. The final product was a sturdy and functional tool that perfectly met my needs.
